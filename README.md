## Model Review


## Towards a Better Model
In the future, I plan to work on the following two projects:

* Build a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model and try feature engineering by transforming
the corpus into a list of sequences using Word2Vec model

* Apply transfer learning model to the corpus using Google's BERT module (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
