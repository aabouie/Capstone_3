## Idea 1: Image segmentation for cardiac images
In this project, the CNN workflow would partition image into a number of semantically meaningful images, based on which quantitative measures can be extracted such as myocardial mass, wall thickness, etc. Based on the numbers and threshold, the cardiac problems can be detected.
There are several resources for MRI scans (https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/508599/fcvm-07-00025-HTML/image_m/fcvm-07-00025-t006.jpg)
The goal is to automatically perform image segmentation and inform the patient of the possible issue with their hear ASAP.

## Idea 2: NLP analysis on Amazon reviews using Spark
In this project, I’ll create a pipeline of gigabyte scale data and use NLP to analyze the sentiment of amazon production reviews using the AWS.
The data is available on : deepyeti.ucsd.edu/jianmo/amazon/index.html which include 233 million reviews. I’ll initially sample from the whole dataset to investigate different scenarios. Then, I’ll deploy the code on AW.

## Idea 3: Recommendation system for skin care products
Creating a content-based recommendation system where the content can be ingredient of cosmetics or it can be based on the reviews from Sephora website. The current dataset has 1472 cosmetic products.
Features are going to be ingredients and 5 additional features.

## IDEA 4- Beer Recommendation System
In this work, I’ll use the available dataset and reviews for beers to create a recommendation system.

## IDEA 5: Coffee recommendation system
As a person who loves to drink coffee every morning, I would like to try different types of coffee and find which one I like more. The goal of this project is to create a recommendation system so if you know a coffee that you like, you can submit the information and the app will analyze the text you’ve given it and recommend a few types of coffee that are similar to what you’ve described.

## Idea 6: Yahoo! Music User Ratings of Musical Artists, version 1.0 (423 MB)
This dataset represents a snapshot of the Yahoo! Music community's preferences for various musical artists. The dataset contains over ten million ratings of musical artists given by Yahoo! Music users over the course of a one month period sometime prior to March 2004. Users are represented as meaningless anonymous numbers so that no identifying information is revealed. (
I’ll use this dataset to create a recommendation system or collaborative filtering algorithms. 
The dataset may be used by researchers to validate recommender systems or collaborative filtering algorithms. The dataset may serve as a testbed for matrix and graph algorithms including PCA and clustering algorithms.

## IDEA 7: L33 - Yahoo News Ranked Multi-label Corpus, version1.0 (59MB)
I’m not still sure that kind of features the dataset have. I’m waiting for approval access to the dataset (https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=l)

## Removing noise from the speeches
In this project, I'm going to train a model to remove the noise from a combination of a speaker's voice and an added noise.


## Recommendation system
I'm still note sure about the topic for the recommendation system.


## Image segmentation of the clothing dataset to segment and recognize clothing piece
I'm trying to find a good database for this topic.
